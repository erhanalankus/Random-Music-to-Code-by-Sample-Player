# Random-Music-to-Code-by-Sample-Player
A web page that plays a random Music to Code by (http://mtcb.pwop.com/) sample on every refresh

It can be used [here](http://yunus.hacettepe.edu.tr/~erhan03/mtcb/)

It plays a four minute sample of a randomly picked track and stops. Refresh the page to play another one.

Carl Franklin, the creater of these 25-minute tracks intended for people to listen to the whole tracks and apply the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). It is good. But I think working in silence is better, so I use this 4-minute samples to make myself start working. If I notice the absence of music, I play another one. If I don't notice the absence of music, it means I'm in a flow and there is no music on the background that may distract me.
